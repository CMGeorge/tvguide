Icons for Australian Free-to-Air TV channels from here:

From the web site: "These are all free for use however you see fit."

The desktop version of the application downloads the icons from the
network on demand.  The mobile version embeds the icons in the application
to avoid expensive network traffic the first time the application runs.
