<title>TV Guide Help - Channel Groups</title>

<body>
Sometimes the <b>All Channels</b> feature can display too many
channels to easily view.  <b>TV Guide</b> can be configured to
remember groups of programmes that contain a subset of the
entire channel list.  The groups are then displayed in the
channels pane:<p>

Select <b>Channel Groups</b> from the <b>Tools</b> menu to edit
the list of channel groups:<p>

<b>All Channels</b> is a permanently available group that does
not need to be configured specially.<p>
