<title>TV Guide Help - Sharing Bookmarks</title>
</head>
<body>
<b>TV Guide</b> can import and export your bookmarks in an XML-based format,
which allows you to share them with others or copy them between multiple
machines that you own that all run <b>TV Guide</b>.<p>

<b>Export</b> on the <b>Bookmarks</b> menu will export all of the
<a href="bookmarks.html">bookmarks</a> and <a href="ticks.html">ticks</a>
to a file with the <i>tvb</i> file extension.<p>

<b>Import</b> on the <b>Bookmarks</b> menu will import the contents of a
<i>tvb</i> file and merge the new bookmarks and ticks with your current
list.  If you already have a bookmark that is listed in the file, then
<b>TV Guide</b> will skip that entry rather than create a duplicate.<p>

Note: bookmarks are specific to the <a href="select_guide.html">guide service</a>
that you are using, so you can only share them with other users that
have the same guide service.  If you are using the OzTivo service,
and you import bookmarks from another region, then the bookmarks will
be automatically converted to your region.<p>
