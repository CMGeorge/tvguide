In addition to <a href="bookmarks.html">bookmarks</a>,
<b>TV Guide</b> can remember single instances of a show as a
form of temporary bookmark called a "tick".  This is useful for
one-off shows such as movies and special episodes where a
permanent bookmark is not appropriate.<p>

Click on a programme you want to tick, and select the <b>Tick Show</b>
option from the <b>Bookmarks</b> menu.  The show will then be shown
with a tick mark wherever it appears:<p>

<center>
<img src="tick_shown.png">
</center><p>

Select <b>Tick Show</b> again to remove the tick mark.  Ticks will
automatically expire after 30 days.<p>

Note that unlike bookmarks, ticks only apply to a specific showing
of the programme.  Repeats of the same programme later in the week
will not be highlighted.<p>
