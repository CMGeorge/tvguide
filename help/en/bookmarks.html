<b>TV Guide</b> can remember programmes from week to week to
highlight them whenever they appear.  First, click on a programme
you are interested in bookmarking:<p>

<center>
<img src="bookmark_new.png">
</center><p>

Then select <b>Add Bookmark</b> from the <b>Bookmarks</b> menu,
which will display the information about the programme:<p>

</center><p>

<b>Season</b> can be left unchecked to match the show in any season.
Seasons can be specified by range with <b>3-6</b> or <b>3+</b>,
or separated by commas as <b>1,3,7</b>.<p>

Press <b>OK</b> to save the bookmark and whenever a programme
appears in the programme list that matches the bookmark,
it will be displayed in the selected color:<p>

If you use <b>Add Bookmark</b> on a programme that is already
bookmarked, then you will be asked if you wish to edit the
existing bookmark's details or add a new bookmark.<p>

The <b>Day</b> drop down list provides a selection of days
for the bookmark: <b>Any day</b>, <b>Monday</b> through <b>Sunday</b>,
<b>Monday to Friday</b>, or <b>Saturday and Sunday</b>.  If you
need some other combination of days, then press the <b>Other</b>
button and select the days manually:<p>

<b>7 Day Bookmark Outlook</b> on the <b>Bookmarks</b> menu will show
the bookmarked programmes for the next 7 days on the current
channel, starting at the selected date in the calendar:<p>

</center><p>

It is also possible to set a bookmark on a programme that isn't
currently shown in the programme view.  This can allow you to
watch out for an upcoming programme that hasn't started yet.
It will be automatically highlighted in the regular view and
the 7 day outlook when the programme starts showing.<p>

If a bookmark matches on the programme name, but not on the
channel, day, or time, then it will be shown in a slightly
darker version of the color.  In the following example,
the bookmark has been set on the 7:30 PM timeslot:<p>

</center><p>

This feature can be enabled or disabled using
<b>Show Partial Matches</b> on the <b>Bookmarks</b> menu.
Combined with the <b>7 Day Bookmark Outlook</b> feature,
partial matches can make it easier to locate a show after it
has moved to a different channel, day, or time.<p>

<b>Show Failed Matches</b> on the <b>Bookmarks</b> menu will
show bookmarks that fail to match the programme exactly with a
strike-through of the bookmark's show title.  This can be used
to notice when a show is no longer playing or it may have moved
to another channel, day, or time:<p>

<b>Organize Bookmarks</b> on the <b>Bookmarks</b> menu can be used
to edit, delete, and create new bookmarks.  Individual bookmarks
can be temporarily disabled for matching by unchecking the
bookmark in the list.<p>
