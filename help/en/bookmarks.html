<b>TV Guide</b> can remember programmes from week to week to
highlight them whenever they appear.  First, click on a programme
you are interested in bookmarking:<p>

<center>
<img src="bookmark_new.png">
</center><p>

Then select <b>Add Bookmark</b> from the <b>Bookmarks</b> menu,
which will display the information about the programme:<p>

</center><p>

<b>Season</b> can be left unchecked to match the show in any season.
Seasons can be specified by range with <b>3-6</b> or <b>3+</b>,
or separated by commas as <b>1,3,7</b>.  Similarily, <b>Year</b> can
be checked to specify a year range.<p>

Press <b>OK</b> to save the bookmark and whenever a programme
appears in the programme list that matches the bookmark,
it will be displayed in the selected color:<p>

</center><p>

If you use <b>Add Bookmark</b> on a programme that is already
bookmarked, then you will be asked if you wish to edit the
existing bookmark's details or add a new bookmark.<p>

The <b>Day</b> drop down list provides a selection of days
for the bookmark: <b>Any day</b>, <b>Monday</b> through <b>Sunday</b>,
<b>Monday to Friday</b>, or <b>Saturday and Sunday</b>.  If you
need some other combination of days, then press the <b>Other</b>
button and select the days manually:<p>

<b>7 Day Bookmark Outlook</b> on the <b>Bookmarks</b> menu will show
the bookmarked programmes for the next 7 days on the current
channel, starting at the selected date in the calendar:<p>

</center><p>

It is also possible to set a bookmark on a programme that isn't
currently shown in the programme view.  This can allow you to
watch out for an upcoming programme that hasn't started yet.
It will be automatically highlighted in the regular view and
the 7 day outlook when the programme starts showing.<p>

If a bookmark matches on the programme name, but not on the
channel, day, or time, then the title will be shown in non-bold.
In the following example, the bookmark has been set on the
7:30 PM timeslot:<p>

<center>

</center><p>

Combined with the <b>7 Day Bookmark Outlook</b> feature,
partial matches can make it easier to locate a show after it
has moved to a different channel, day, or time.<p>

If the bookmark is marked as <b>On Air</b> and the programme is
no longer shown in its bookmarked timeslot, then the programme
will be shown with a strike-through of the bookmark's show title:<p>

<center>
<img src="bookmark_failed.png">
</center><p>

If <b>TV Guide</b> has seen the same show in a different
timeslot or on a different channel, then it may list those
on the popup tooltip so you can update your bookmarks:<p>

<center>
<img src="bookmark_failed_moved.png">
</center><p>

You can look for partial matches to see if the show has moved
to another channel or time.  If it has moved, then update the
bookmark to reflect the new details.  If however the show is
no longer on, but may return at a later date, then change the
bookmark to <b>Off Air</b>.  When the show returns, it will
be shown as follows:<p>

<center>
<img src="bookmark_returned.png">
</center><p>

<b>Organize Bookmarks</b> on the <b>Bookmarks</b> menu can be used
to edit, delete, and create new bookmarks.<p>
