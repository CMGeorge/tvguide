<body>
<b>TV Guide</b> can remember programmes from week to week to
highlight them whenever they appear.  First, click on a programme
you are interested in bookmarking:<p>

<center>
<img src="bookmark_new.png">
</center><p>

Then select <b>Add Bookmark</b> from the <b>Tools</b> menu,
which will display the information about the programme:<p>

<center>
<img src="bookmark_edit.png">
</center><p>

Press <b>OK</b> to save the bookmark and whenever a programme
appears in the programme list that matches the bookmark,
it will be displayed in the selected color:<p>

<center>
<img src="bookmark_set.png">
</center><p>

<b>7 Day Bookmark Outlook</b> on the <b>View</b> menu will show
the bookmarked programmes for the next 7 days on the current
channel, starting at the selected date in the calendar:<p>

<center>

</center><p>

It is also possible to set a bookmark on a programme that isn't
currently shown in the programme view.  This can allow you to
watch out for an upcoming programme that hasn't started yet.
It will be automatically highlighted in the regular view and
the 7 day outlook when the programme starts showing.<p>

<b>Organize Bookmarks</b> on the <b>Tools</b> menu can be used
to edit, delete, and create new bookmarks.<p>
