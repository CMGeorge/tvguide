When <b>TV Guide</b> starts the first time it will ask you
to select a service supplying TV guide data:<p>

You can select from the predefined list of services or add a
<b>New</b> service:<p>

<p>Three pieces of information are required to define a service:

<ul>
<li>Name of the service.</li>
<li>URL where the channel index can be found.</li>
<li>Time in hours to use to refresh old data from the URL.</li>
</ul>

The URL for supported services usually ends in
<i>channels.xml.gz</i> or <i>datalist.xml.gz</i>.  If your guide
service provides both, then <i>datalist.xml.gz</i> is preferred
as it leads to better data caching.<p>

Once you have selected a guide service, you will be given an
opportunity to <a href="edit_channels.html">edit the list of
channels</a> that are displayed.<p>

You can select a new service at any time using the
<b>Select guide service</b> option on the <b>File</b> menu.<p>

<a href="index.html">Return to main index</a>
